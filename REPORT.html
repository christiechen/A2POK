    <h1> Question 1 </h1>
    <section id='q1'>
        <h2> Daily Schedule of a GasTech Employee </h2>
        <p>
            <b class='notice'> A very general layout of a single workday for a GasTech employee. </b>
        </p>
        <ul> 
            <li>7:30-7:50 AM — Daily coffee at the place of choice
                <img src='writeUp/images/coffee-daily.png' />
                We can see that employees are clustured around coffee shops on the way to/around the GasTech building: Jack's Magical Beans, Hallowed Grounds, Cup o' Joe, Brewe've Been Served, and Katerina's Cafe.
            </li>
            <li>8-8:30 AM — Employees seem to start working in this time period. Security starts to drive to GasTech around 8, and most Engineers join by 8:20.</li>
            <li>12-1:30PM — Lunch break starts. Following a good 2-3 hours of mostly inactivity after people arrive at work, there is a flurry of activity from the company cars in all departments starting at 12. Employees mostly buy lunch or run errands; some go to the grocery store or visit other nearby areas on the way back to work.</li>
            <li>1:30-2PM — Lunch break ends. Company cars in all departments start to drive back towards GasTech at 1:30.
                <img src='writeUp/images/back-from-work.png' />

                By hovering over the dots and looking at tooltips in the visualization, you can track the movement of the dots.
            </li>
            <li>Evening — In the evening, employees may host gatherings at bars or generally meet up. They also run personal errands, such as grocery shopping, etc...</li>
        </ul>

                        All of the people involved in this pattern were previously suspect for POK involvement. It's possible that this area next to Guy's Gyros and Frydos Autosupply is a meeting area for POK members — both within GasTech and outside of GasTech.

                        10/10: this is consistent behavior over multiple days. Not many other people with GPS data travel as far as Frydos. Additionally, all people involved were labeled suspicious in A1 for reasons including but not limited to the following:

                        The increased frequency of purchases at Guy's Gyros imply that the Security department is disproportionally in that area at all times, sometimes late at night (10 or 11PM). This supports the theory that there is some kind of meeting spot in that area.

                        <ul>
                            <li> Looking at Lucas's other purchases, he typically spends at most $200-$300 dollars; $10,000 is an anomaly. </li>
                            <li> Lucas isn't actually at Frydos when this credit card transaction goes through. He is at Ouzeri Elian, where Loreto Bodrogi is also located. Everyone at Frydos is majority security.</li>
                            <li> 10 minutes after the $10,000 purchase, Lucas uses his credit card at Ouzeri Elian. Loreto Bodrogi leaves Ouzeri after the Ouzeri purchase was made.</li>

                        There are two possibilities:

                            <li>
                                1) Lucas is unaware of his credit card information being used elsewhere. Loreto is at the bar with Lucas to distract him until the $10,000 transaction went through.
                            </li>

                                2) Lucas is aware of his credit card information being used elsewhere. Loreto and Lucas arrived to the bar around the same time (6:46PM). It's possible that either Loreto or Lucas carpooled with someone else to go Frydos and make the purchase before coming back to the bar and leaving soon after.
                            </li>

                        8/10: While we are not sure what Lucas's involvement with the POK is, we are rather certain that there is something fishy behind this purchase; it was such an out-of-norm purchase for Lucas, and he wasn't at the location at that time.

                                As an Asterian, he is either FOR the MDMC distribution, or he is AGAINST distributing MDMC. If he is FOR distribution, he could be a top target for the POK. If he is AGAINST distribution, he could be working with the POK. Either way, police could study the POK by digging into Strum's activity prior to the kidnapping.

                               Generally speaking, this golf game should be of interest — it's the last time all executives of GasTech are together before the kidnapping.

                        6/10: We don't know have data for other weeks; do executives usually miss golf games? Does Strum have a weekly activity that usually conflicts with golf games? However, despite this missing data, any activity around Strum should be investigated as he is the only executive not from Tethys.

                                They might have been setting something up at the hotel for the week prior to Sanjorge's arrival, given that they check out the day before he arrives.

                        7/10: There is a very clear pattern that is unique to these people, and it is very suspicious that they were at the hotel for the entire week, just until Sanjorge checked in. However, they were not suspicious persons in A1.

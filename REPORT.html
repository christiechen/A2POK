                        All of the people involved in this pattern were previously suspect for POK involvement. It's possible that this area next to Guy's Gyros and Frydos Autosupply is a meeting area for POK members — both within GasTech and outside of GasTech.

                            <li> Looking at Lucas's other purchases, he typically spends at most $200-$300 dollars; $10,000 is an anomaly. </li>

                        There are two possibilities:

                            <li>
                                1) Lucas is unaware of his credit card information being used elsewhere. Loreto is at the bar with Lucas to distract him until the $10,000 transaction went through.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2) Lucas is aware of his credit card information being used elsewhere. Loreto and Lucas arrived to the bar around the same time (6:46PM). It's possible that either Loreto or Lucas carpooled with someone else to go Frydos and make the purchase before coming back to the bar and leaving soon after.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        8/10: While we are not sure what Lucas's involvement with the POK is, we are rather certain that there is something fishy behind this purchase; it was such an out-of-norm purchase for Lucas, and he wasn't at the location at that time.

                                1) Lucas is visiting someone in the hospital on a semi-regular basis. We know from previous articles that GasTech pollution could cause hospitalization. This could be an indicator that he is working with the POK against GasTech.

                                2) Lucas is in late at night more often than his coworkers — this raises the question of why he is there so late and what he could potentially access when alone in the building. It's possible he was working overtime.

                                Security could be taking advantage of the fact that everyone is busy doing other things to meet about POK activity.

                                Security seems to mainly be leaving from the Frydos area discussed in (1), which further reinforces the theory that there is a meeting spot in that area.

                        The lone facility employee with GPS data, Bertrand Ovan, drove in a large circle late at night.

                                Outside of this event, Betrand does not have such a clear and widespread path. He usually stays in the bottom right hand corner of the map only.

                                This behavior is different from other nights. In emails, he emphasizes being careful when driving, but driving this late seems to conflict with his overly-cautious attitude.

                                It's possible that he knows something about the kidnapping (not necessarily that he is a part of it), as he took an unexpected route that could have thrown POK members off guard.
